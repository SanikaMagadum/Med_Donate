# Medicine Donation Portal

## Overview
The **Medicine Donation Portal** is an online platform designed to facilitate the collection and distribution of unused medicines to those in need. The system ensures the usability of donated medicines by checking their expiry dates and connects donors, receivers, and NGOs through a centralized web-based portal. Unlike traditional medicine donation apps, this portal is accessible via any system without requiring users to download an application.
